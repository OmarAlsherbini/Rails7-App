# Events App: https://rails-events-geocoder-devise.herokuapp.com/

## Gems Installed
```
gem 'devise'
gem 'geocoder'
gem 'devise-jwt'
gem 'fast_jsonapi'
```
## Devise & Devise JWT Authentication
The app allows for user registration and login/logout via `devise` gem. However, this alone is meant to be used in HTML format, and doesn't quite support JSON requests with `Bearer` tokens to authenticate API JSON requests to access methods requiring user authentication. <br/>
To fix that, another gem, `devise-jwt` is also installed, and while Rails project with `devise-jwt` would generally require an API-only app created from scratch for it, adjustments had to be made to its integration to make it compatible with the current HTML-based Rails app, following [this JWT Logins on Existing HTML Rails 5 App tutorial](https://medium.com/@brentkearney/json-web-token-jwt-and-html-logins-with-devise-and-ruby-on-rails-5-9d5e8195193d), with further modifications to the tutorials implementation to make it compatible with Rails 7 and its Turbo Stream components. <br/>
Thus, a lot of edits were performed to the original default Devise `User` controllers and models, in addition to further changes to `devise.rb`, `routes.rb` and even the `application_controller.rb` itself. <br/>
## Geocoder Component
The app uses `Geocoder`to get the physical address and the Lat-Long coordinates of the user, generally within 20 minutes by car of accuracy, and workable with Windscibe VPN browser extension. <br/>
Th geocoder component doesn't work in development environment however, only in production. Thus, the app is also deployed to Heroku for functionality testing <br/>
**Heroku deployment:** https://rails-events-geocoder-devise.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
The user's location info is updated and stored into his `User` data upon signup, every login and every event creation done by them.
## Events App
The app allows a user to create an `Event` of `type 1` (scheduled) with another user based on their schedules, or create an `Event` of `type 0` (blocked) for his own calendar. <br/>
> Events cannot overlap based on their `start_date`s and `end_date`s unless explicitely specified as such by an `overwritable` flag which is `false` by default. Creating an `overwritable` `Event` of `type 0` isn't allowed. <br/>
> Creating an `Event` of `type 1` would create 2 `UserEvent`s for the **host** user and the **current** user (logged in user). The `UserEvent` of one user contain the info of the other user with which the `Event` is scheduled, including his name, location info and performance (initialized as `nil`). <br/>
> Each created `Event` is associated with a particular `MonthApp` through `month_app_id`. For example, A created `Event` with a `start_date` in November 2022 created in October 2022 **must have** a `month_app_id` of 19, assuming that the `CalendarApp` is created with the default settings. Specifying anything different than this for the request will result in a `HTTP Error 400 Bad Request`. <br/>
> Created events also allow for `datetime` `start_date`s and `end_date`s, meaning that the overlap logic extends to the single minute as of now. The frontend integration can modulate that further for 15 minutes modularity.
> `all_day` flags also exists for the frontend integration in case they want to modulate that even further into a full day event without hours.
> An **`eventData`** JSON object exist for a `User`'s list of `Event`s and `UserEvent`s through the associated `get_user_events` method.

Exit to your main terminal:
```
exit
```
## 3) Install Tailwind CSS
```
sudo npm install tailwindcss@^1
```
## 4) Install Redis
```
sudo apt install redis
sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service
```
## 5) Install Rails
```
sudo gem install rails
```

## 6) Clone this repo
```
git clone  https://github.com/OmarAlsherbini/Rails7-App.git
cd Rails7-App
sudo bundle install
```

## 7) DB Connection
Create encryption for you DB connection via:
```
EDITOR=nano rails credentials:edit
```
This will create config/master.key to decrypt credentials.yml.enc file which contains the DB credentials, and config/master.key will be added to the .gitignore file. It will also give you an error, because the key generated just now can't decrypt the encrypted file in this repository, so to fix this, open config/master.key, and replace this key with the key your team have in your password manager for this project. <br/>
Now you can connect to your DB by typing:
```
EDITOR=nano rails credentials:edit
```
In this file, please add:
```
database:
  username: <your_username>
  password: <your_password>
```
Create and migrate the DB via:
```
rails db:create db:migrate
```
If, for whatever reason, this still gave you the following error:
```
ActiveRecord::DatabaseConnectionError: There is an issue connecting to your database with your username/password, username: <your_username>.
```
Then please double check  your created PostgreSQL user credentials and what you inserted in the rails credentials encrypted file. If everything frustratingly seems correct, then you might want to go back to your PostgreSQL and enter the following query:
```
ALTER USER <your_username> WITH PASSWORD '<your_password>';
```
Even if you use the exact same credentials you inserted before. Yes, I know that this doesn't make much sense, but I ran into the same issue and this solved it for me. It could be either a bug in PostgreSQL or rails or Linux... idk... but by then we should expect the creation and migration of the DB to go smoothly and the connection to the DB to be correctly established.

## 8) Rails Startup
To run the project, run:
```
rails s
```
If you want to run the project with JS console open, run:
```
./bin/dev
```
In case you encountered the following error while running the project:

```
ActionView::Template::Error (The asset "tailwind.css" is not present in the asset pipeline.
```
Or
```
ActionView::Template::Error (The asset "application.css" is not present in the asset pipeline.
```
Then perform the following commands to fix it:
```
gem install bundler
bundle update --bundler
bundle install
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
```
And then:
```
./bin/dev
```
And in case you encountered the following error while running the project:
```
/bin/sh: 1: esbuild: not found
```
Then you can fix esbuild by running the following commands:
```
sudo apt install rollup
./bin/rails javascript:install:rollup
./bin/rails javascript:install:esbuild
./bin/rails javascript:install:webpack
```
And then:
```
./bin/dev
```
## 9) Test the Posts App
Head to ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/posts/```, styled by Tailwind CSS. <br/>
There, you will see a random word popping out of the Redis cache every time you refresh with a second expiry. You can check the redis behavior by opening a new terminal in the same directory and running:
```
redis-cli monitor
```
In order to see posts, you can open another terminal in the same directory and run:
```
rails c
```
There, you can write the following command in the rails CLI:
```
Post.create(title:"Hello World!", body: "Body!", views:0) 
```
You can watch on the page that this post gets broadcasted immediately on the page, proving the functionality of Hotwire (TurboJs + StimulusJs built in Rails 7), it would also show in the terminal the Turbo cable... although at the moment you would need to refresh the page to get it styled with Tailwind CSS for newly created posts. You can open the PSQL DB rails_proj_development, and in the table "posts", you will see that a new post has been created, proving the functionalty of PSQL.  <br/>

DONE!
